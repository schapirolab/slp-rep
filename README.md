Hippocampal Sleep-Replay Model

This is a hippocampal model (based on [Schapiro et. al. 2017a](https://cb17cd36-5a57-45de-9d66-0b98a3dc5be9.filesusr.com/ugd/b37d16_5edf4f04f8fb4f8eb717d38e4ca42c3e.pdf) and the CCN Textbook hip example) modified to perform sleep replay. The model autonomously replays stimuli learned through error-driven learning when awake and uses an oscillation-based learning rule during sleep in order to improve its own performance. It is currently set up to simulate the structured satellite learning task from [Schapiro et al. 2017b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12884-5.pdf).
